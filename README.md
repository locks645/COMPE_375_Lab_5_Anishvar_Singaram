# COMPE_375_Lab_5_Anishvar_Singaram
An interesting lab from my Embedded Systems Programming course which had us manipulate PWM waveforms to create musical sounds on an ATmega328PB microcontroller. The board is attached to a 4x4 keypad; each button corresponds to a note starting from middle A (440Hz) and goes up in half steps from there.
